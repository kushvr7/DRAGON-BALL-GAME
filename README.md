# DRAGON-BALL-GAME
JAVASCRIPT BASED WEB GAME . (stay tuned !)

MOST AMAZING THING ABOUT THE PROJECT IS THAT IT WORK ON KEYBOARD INPUTS .
ex: like controls for player 1 are 
   1) "ARROWLEFT" to move left .
   2) "ARROWRIGHT" to move right .
   3) "ARROWTOP" to move top .
   4) "ARROWDOWN" to move down .
   5) "K" to powerUP.
   6) "O" to telePort .
   7) "L" to shoot .
   8) "P" to powerDown .
   
   AND MANY POWER MORE INTERESTING CONTROLS .
   
   Its a 2 person game(MULTIPLAYER) in which to fighters will move to hit each other .
The one who hit the maximum in the given time wins the match .
There are also many powers given to the players .
if they make hit greater then they evolve, like Goku to SUPER SAIYAN .
